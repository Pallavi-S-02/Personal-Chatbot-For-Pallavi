### Key Features:

1. **Personalization** : Tailored to Pallavi's preferences and interests, leading to more meaningful interactions.
2. **Gemini Pro LLM**: Employs the capabilities of a powerful LLM for comprehensive understanding and response generation.
3. **LangChain Integration**: Seamlessly integrates with LangChain for efficient and structured information retrieval.
